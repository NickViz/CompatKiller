# CompatKiller
This application monitors and kills annoying CompatTelRunner.exe Windows process.

First, I don't want any (compatibility) telemety at all.
Second, it burns my notebook CPU and drains its battery.

I tried to disable this Windows functionality in a proper way, but without luck, so, I wrote this app.
